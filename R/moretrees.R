#' moretrees: fitting Multi-Outcome Regression with 
#' Tree-structured Shrinkage (MOReTreeS) models
#'
#'   Fits MOReTreeS model to matched case-control or case-crossover data.
#'   The posterior is approximated via variational inference.
#'   Returns estimated outcome groups and group-specific coefficient 
#'   estimates with credible intervals. See \code{vignette('moretrees')} for
#'   model details and example usage.
